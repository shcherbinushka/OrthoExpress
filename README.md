It was an attempt to visualize the level of orthological gene expression for a given set of genes between two given species.

The project was carried out in 40 hours within the framework of the hackathon on bioinformatics. As a result of the erroneous allocation of time, the project remained in a raw state, but we believe that someday we will bring it to mind. Thanks to my team and genestack platform for the idea.

Work was made with unholyparrot.
